 technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions
 and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. EACoin Core
 is the name of the open source software which enables the use of this currency.

 tool which can be used without a eacoin daemon.  Some means of
 exchanging minimal transaction data with peers is still required.
